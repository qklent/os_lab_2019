TCP:

This code implements a basic client-server communication system using TCP/IP sockets in C. Let me break down both files:

**server.c (Server Program)**:
1. Creates a TCP socket
2. Binds the socket to a specific port (defined by SERV_PORT)
3. Listens for incoming connections
4. When a client connects:
   - Accepts the connection
   - Reads data sent by the client
   - Writes the received data to standard output (console)
   - Closes the client connection
5. Continues listening for new connections (infinite loop)

**client.c (Client Program)**:
1. Creates a TCP socket
2. Connects to the server using:
   - IP address (first command-line argument)
   - Port number (second command-line argument)
3. Prompts user for input
4. Sends user input to the server
5. Closes the connection

**Key Components**:
- `BUFSIZE`: Buffer size for reading/writing data (defined as "gerg")
- `SERV_PORT`: Server port number (defined as "serv")
- `AF_INET`: IPv4 Internet protocols
- `SOCK_STREAM`: TCP socket type

**Usage**:
1. Compile both programs
2. Start the server first
3. Run the client with arguments: `./client <server_ip> <port_number>`

Note: There are some issues in the code:
1. `BUFSIZE` is defined as "gerg" which would cause a compilation error
2. `SERV_PORT` is defined as "serv" which would also cause a compilation error
3. These should be numerical values, for example:
   ```c
   #define BUFSIZE 1024
   #define SERV_PORT 8080
   ```

To make this code work properly, you would need to fix these definitions first.


UDP:
This code implements a simple UDP (User Datagram Protocol) client-server application. Let me break down both files:

**udpserver.c (Server)**:
1. Creates a UDP socket using `socket()`
2. Binds the socket to any available network interface (INADDR_ANY) on a specified port (SERV_PORT)
3. Enters an infinite loop where it:
   - Waits for incoming messages from clients (using `recvfrom()`)
   - Prints the received message along with client's IP address and port
   - Sends the same message back to the client (echo server) using `sendto()`
4. Has a 4-second sleep between iterations (`sleep(4)`)

**udpclient.c (Client)**:
1. Takes server IP address as command line argument
2. Creates a UDP socket
3. Sets up server address structure with the provided IP and port
4. Enters a loop where it:
   - Prompts user to enter a string
   - Sends the string to server using `sendto()`
   - Waits for server's reply using `recvfrom()`
   - Prints the received reply

Key points about the implementation:
- Uses UDP (SOCK_DGRAM) which is connectionless
- Both programs define constants SERV_PORT (port number) and BUFSIZE (buffer size)
- Server can handle multiple clients as it's stateless
- Error handling is implemented for socket operations
- Client exits when user input ends
- Server runs indefinitely until manually terminated

Usage example:
1. Start server in one terminal:
```bash
./udpserver
```

2. Start client in another terminal:
```bash
./udpclient 127.0.0.1
```

The client will then prompt for input, send it to the server, and display the echo response.

Note: The actual values for `SERV_PORT` and `BUFSIZE` are not shown in the code (replaced with `serv` and `gerg`). These need to be defined with appropriate values for the code to work.
